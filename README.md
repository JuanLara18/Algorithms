# Algorithms

This repository is for the Algorithms course at the National University of Colombia for the 2023-1 semester.  In the following is a description of each work developed

* [X] **1 __Introduction to the Python Laboratory Task with Numpy, Pandas, and Data Visualization__:**

> In this laboratory task, we will use Python programming in the Google Colab environment to learn about variables, data types, control structures, functions, and other Python programming aspects. We will also learn about the NumPy and Pandas libraries for data analysis and manipulation, and the Matplotlib library for data visualization. Through working on real-world examples, we will gain valuable experience that will prepare us for more advanced programming tasks in the future.


* [X] **2 __The PyData Toolbox with Scott Sanderson__:**

> In this laboratory, you will reproduce and modify the content of the "The PyData Toolbox with Scott Sanderson" video by Scott Sanderson on YouTube. You will copy the Lab2.ipynb file into your Google Drive, which is a modified version of Scott Sanderson's Ipython notebook from the talk. You will correct the Python matrix multiplication code, ensuring that the matrix dimensions are compatible. For each code cell that you write, you will add text cells with labels such as "My own example k," "My own example k+1," etc.
>
>Additionally, you will write code for matrix multiplication in several programming languages such as NumPy, C, C++, JavaScript, and Java. You will run all codes for 10 times using the same 600Ã—100 and 100x600 matrices used in Python while measuring and collecting the running times. After that, you will build a dataframe with the average times and the speed factor compared to the language that is faster.
>
>To use the read_avocados function from check AvocadosDataRead.ipynb, you will include an analysis similar to the one performed with the avocados data using any data set from [datos.gov.co](datos.gov.co).

* [X] **3 __Applied Data Science with Python in [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/)__:**

> In this lab we compiled the certificates of three courses from the cognitiveclass.ai platform, which are:
>
> 1. **"Python for Data Science":** this introductory Python course teaches you the fundamentals of programming with Python, specifically in the context of data science. This course is beginner-friendly and will take you from zero to Python programming in a matter of hours. By the end of the course, you will be able to write your own Python scripts and perform basic data analysis using our Jupyter-based lab environment. If you want to learn Python from scratch and have no programming experience, this course is for you.
> 2. **"Data Analysis with Python:** In this course, you will learn how to analyze data using Python. The course starts from the basics of Python and takes you to explore many different types of data. You will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more. In addition, you will learn how to import and clean data sets, manipulate pandas DataFrames, summarize data, build machine learning models with scikit-learn, and build data pipelines. The course is delivered through lectures, hands-on labs and assignments, and covers a wide range of data analysis libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, SciPy and scikit-learn.
> 3. **"Data Visualization with Python":** Data visualization is the graphical representation of data for the purpose of interactively and efficiently conveying ideas to customers, users and stakeholders in general. In this course you will learn how to create interesting charts and graphs and customize them to make them more effective and enjoyable for your audience. One of the main objectives of this course is to teach you how to take data that at first glance has little meaning and present it in a way that makes sense to people. Several techniques for presenting data visually are covered, but this course uses several Python data visualization libraries, including Matplotlib, seaborn, and Folium. In this course you will learn how to create scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, maps and more using these libraries.
