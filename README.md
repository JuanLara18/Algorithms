# Algorithms

This repository is for the Algorithms course at the National University of Colombia for the 2023-1 semester.  In the following is a description of each work developed

* [X] **1 __Introduction to the Python Laboratory Task with Numpy, Pandas, and Data Visualization__:**

> In this laboratory task, we will use Python programming in the Google Colab environment to learn about variables, data types, control structures, functions, and other Python programming aspects. We will also learn about the NumPy and Pandas libraries for data analysis and manipulation, and the Matplotlib library for data visualization. Through working on real-world examples, we will gain valuable experience that will prepare us for more advanced programming tasks in the future.
