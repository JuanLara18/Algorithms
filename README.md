# Algorithms

This repository is for the Algorithms course at the National University of Colombia for the 2023-1 semester.  In the following is a description of each work developed

* [X] **1 __Introduction to the Python Laboratory Task with Numpy, Pandas, and Data Visualization__:**

  In this laboratory task, we will apply and expand our knowledge of Python programming, using the Google Colab environment as our development platform. The task is based on a Colab notebook provided by the instructor here, which covers various aspects of Python programming, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and more.

  The notebook also provides an introduction to two powerful libraries for data analysis and manipulation: NumPy and Pandas. NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, providing support for powerful N-dimensional arrays and a wide range of mathematical functions. Pandas, on the other hand, is a popular library for data manipulation and analysis, providing powerful data structures for working with tabular data.

  We will also learn about data visualization using the Matplotlib library, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating a wide range of visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and more.

  During the laboratory task, we will have the opportunity to work on our own examples, applying the concepts and techniques covered in the notebook to real-world problems. By the end of the task, we will have gained valuable experience working with Python and the NumPy and Pandas libraries, as well as data visualization, which will prepare us for more advanced programming tasks in the future.
